= ARMeasurementAttributes

Rails plugin for displaying measurement attributes.

== Examples

Assuming you have an attribute called 'distance' defined on your Trip model and you 
would like to display it as a length measurement:

class Trip < ActiveRecord::Base
  length :distance, :internal => :kilometres, :external => :miles, :precision => 2
end

When you want to display distance in the external format:

>> trip = Trip.new(:distance => 78.348)
>> trip.pretty_distance
#=> "48.68mi"

== Adding Unit Conversions

This gem relies on the conversions gem. Simply use the Conversions.register method 
to add a new unit of conversion.

== Measurement Options

 * internal - the internal representation of the measurement. This is the format in 
    which the data will be saved. All assignments to the attribute must be in this
    unit of measurement.
 * external - the external representation of the measurement. When the pretty_* 
    method is called, the appropriate label is added to the output.
 * precision - the number of decimal places to display. The value will be rounded.
 * hide_zeros_for_whole_numbers - hide the decimal places if the value is a whole number.

== Adding Measurement Types

You can add your own measurement types and their default options via:

ARMeasurementAttributes.default_measurements[:interplanetary_speed] = { 
  :internal => :metres_per_second, :external => :parsecs
}

This will enable:

class MilleniumFalcon < ActiveRecord::Base
  interplanetary_speed :kessel_run_record
end
