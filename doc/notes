Storage of each property (existing AR migration or generate a migration for a new property?)

Accessing a property should return an object that can be converted to imperial units (or just to_s?)

Object to represent measurement:

record.fuel_economy = 88
record.fuel_economy.humanize
# => 32mpg


AR Storage of value in metric is important

record.fuel_economy = 77
record.save <= Magic goes here
